These are materials for an introduction to the mathematics of machine learning. The course begins by reviewing/learning concepts from linear algebra. Then, emphasizing an intuitive approach, students learn how to train and construct feedforward neural networks. 

Here is the progression I recommend assuming 50-minute class periods:

- Intro Slides (0.5 day)

- WS 1 (1.5 days)

- WS 3 (1 day)

- WS 2 (2-3 days)

- FNNs Slides (maybe they should be split up, if so stochastic gradient descent stuff could be introduced after WS 4) (2 days)

- WS 4 (2-3 days)

- Jupyter Notebook 1 (1 day or could be homework)

- Jupyter Notebook 2 (1-2 days or could be homework)

- Project 1: How to Train Your Model (1 day or could be homework)

- WS 5 (2-3 days)

- Jupyter Notebook 3 (2-3 days or could be homework)

- Project 2: Getting to Know Machine Learning (students worked in paris, gave students 1-2 days in class time to prepare and 2 days of presentations)
