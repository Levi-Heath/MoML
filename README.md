These are materials for an Introduction to the Mathematics of Machine Learning. The course begins by reviewing/learning concepts from linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Then, emphasizing an intuitive approach, students learn how to construct and train feedforward neural networks. 

Here is the progression I recommend assuming 50-minute class periods:

- Intro Slides (0.5 day)

- Worksheet 1 (1.5 days)

- Worksheet 3 (1 day)

- Worksheet 2 (2-3 days)

- FNNs Slides (maybe they should be split up, if so stochastic gradient descent stuff could be introduced after WS 4) (2 days)

- Worksheet 4 (2-3 days)

- Jupyter Notebook 1 (1 day or could be homework)

- Jupyter Notebook 2 (1-2 days or could be homework)

- Project 1: How to Train Your Model (1 day or could be homework)

- Worksheet 5 (2-3 days)

- Jupyter Notebook 3 (2-3 days or could be homework)

- Project 2: Getting to Know Machine Learning 
    - Students worked in paris, gave students 1-2 days in class time to prepare and 2 days of presentations.

- Project 3: Advanced Training (from scratch) - Part 1 (2 days or could be homework)

- Project 3: Advanced Training (from scratch) - Part 2 (1 day or could be homework)
    - Want to improve this by asking students to adapt their code from Jupyter Notebook 3 so that their neural network could have an arbitrary number of hidden layers and softmax as the activation function in the output layer.
