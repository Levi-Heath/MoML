These are materials for an introduction to the mathematics of machine learning. The course begins by reviewing/learning concepts from linear algebra. Then, emphasizing an intuitive approach, students learn how to train and construct feedforward neural networks. 

Here is the progression I recommend assuming 50-minute class periods:\n
  Intro Slides (0.5 day)\n
  WS 1 (1.5 days)\n
  WS 3 (1 day)\n
  WS 2 (2-3 days)\n
  FNNs Slides (maybe they should be split up, if so stochastic gradient descent stuff could be introduced after WS 4) (2 days)\n
  WS 4 (2-3 days)\n
  Jupyter Notebook 1 (1 day or could be homework)\n
  Jupyter Notebook 2 (1-2 days or could be homework)\n
  Project 1: How to Train Your Model (1 day or could be homework)\n
  WS 5 (2-3 days)\n
  Jupyter Notebook 3 (2-3 days or could be homework)\n
  Project 2: Getting to Know Machine Learning (students worked in paris, gave students 1-2 days in class time to prepare and 2 days of presentations)
